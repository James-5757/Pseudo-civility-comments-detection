He was the Perfect Master.  He Was God incarnated, Saviour of Mankind and so on.  In fact, Jossi still thinks he's all of that.

If we REALLY don't want to do ANY original research, many parts of many articles in wikipedia should be deleted. All the articles will become mere quotes from several scholars without any glue to keep different quotes together. You statement that I am doing original research is by itself an original research!!

If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.NEWLINE_TOKENIf you truly object to editors ``fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,`` then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: ``If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.``NEWLINE_TOKENI strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.NEWLINE_TOKENI am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia.

The veracity of his own account cannot be determined; it resembles a common urban legend.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso changed subtitle that may have been legally actionable and was undoubtedly a personal attack. It was put up 22 November 2006, reverted 28 November 2006, and has been there until now. Look for this abuse to return soon.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN Facts are stubborn.  NEWLINE_TOKEN: The US Federal government's definition of sexual assault includes ``inappropriate touching`` (see ) Ellison's sexual assault on Willis at the Hugo Awards is thoroughly documented to an unusual extent for any encyclopedia: to use correct terminology for an event that is completely verifiable is certainly not actionable.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::The first of the 'Three Most Important Things' anecdote was retitled by an anon editor who objected to having Ellison's self-described behavior referred to as 'sexual assault'. I put it back in because it is sourced as well as any of the other controversies and is certainly notable: Ellison not only published the anecdote he told, but is reported to have recounted it several times at conventions.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Provided it is from a reliable sourced (it is) and we make it clear it's veracity is uncertain (we do) there are only two other issues. Is it sufficiently noteable (appears to be but can't say for sure) and is it documented as controversial (no clear info on this)? The fact that you and I may think it is controversial is irrelevant if it isn't documented as controversial. Given it's noteability, there might be merit to include it somewhere else if it isn't documented as controversial but not in the controversies section  NEWLINE_TOKEN::: Will try to find documentation of controversy: what controversy I'm aware of occurred exclusively in fandom, which tends not to be documented up to Wikipedia standards.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::deleted portion had nothing to do with Connie Willis incident. It was the quoted section from his essay. Pointless, with a title that amounts to a personal attack. It came back. It has been removed again. Please do not turn this into an edit war, but consider why you feel the need to hate Mr. Ellison and to continual find ways to attack him in an encyclopedia. Facts are stubborn.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::: Please remember: assume good faith. Accusations that wiki editors include information in biographies based on personal animosity towards the subject, is hardly an assumption of good faith. This anecdote is directly sourced to Ellison: it may or may not to be true, but not only did he repeat it at several conventions, he also published it under his own name as something he had done. It is therefore quite literally a self-incriminating account of a sexual assault Ellison carried out, or said he did, in 1962. The argument has been made that this is ``not controversial``, and therefore ought to be under a different section: I cannot, however, see any good reason to remove it altogether: though as you will see other anecdotes that are not sourced have been removed.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::I can still see no reason that this incident should even be in an ``encyclopedia``, even a self-labeled one. Use of the inflammatory label ``sexual assault`` appears to meet standard of personal attack, and if it cannot be supported in its legal meaning, it is actionable.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::I also do not see why that particular terminology is so important when there are other terms that would not look like personal attack could easily be substituted.

", 18 January 2007 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.NEWLINE_TOKENJerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)NEWLINE_TOKENAnd about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name. Again, dont go off the topic, this was about hte inquisition.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd yes, I bloomin love life under Islam, as a woman I feel liberated and free, and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported, and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth (there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans!!!!) If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us.

I assume that Mr Merkey is aware that by his neo-stalinist purging of what he considers to be ``wannabee`` or ``fake`` indian groups, and his near-instantaneous deletion of any comments not in complete agreement with his POV, he is removing valuable and, more to the point, interesting, content from Wikipedia.  I have no disagreement with his flagging of non-federally recognised groups and bands as such, but I take exception at the manner in which it is done, the tone of Template:NorthAmNativeUnverified is aggressive and unpleasant, and his proposed policy positively reeks of racism.

"`:::::: Dear Chris, It took me a while to uderstand what happened. Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your ``seen in the above insulting comments`` which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say ``where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools``. Why do you think that ``Einstein, Landau and Feynman`` are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned ``world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools``. So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was ``willing to discuss`` various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to ``edit warring`` consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me.

"`I still cannot believe that there can be a controversy over our national anthem! This is absurd! What the hell happened? Freedom of speech, I am all for it. But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting ``immigrants``. They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of ``God`` and ``son`` means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be ``friends``??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like ``The Beatles``! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: ``You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you.`` This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to ``area of rest``- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. Please, I beg, I PRAY, (God forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize ``Don't sweat the small stuff``. Get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. It's an imperfect world, you can't have your way all the time. If someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. You stay away from them. SO? Does that not apply to here?

The fact that France slipped from being the top European power to a secondary level, clearly below Britain's and soon also below Germany's and even Austria's, is hardly contentious.

Even if one were to concede that it was the main ``continental`` power, that would imply a loss of status - before the Napoleonic Wars, it was the main European power, including Britain, and had beaten combined enemy armies time and time again. As for keeping great power status to this day, I'm sure that that should come as great surprise to the French, humiliated by Nazi occupation and resolutely defeated both in Vietnam and Algeria.

Prove me wrong, I won't mind.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat is clear is that The Grand Lodge of New York is bound by the policies of The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America which has specifically removed any claim to be the arbiters of Masonic regularity, quite rightly, and good on them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTake a look at their 2007 and 2008 reports.

The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America (including the Grand Master of The Grand Lodge of New York) is NOT the arbiter of Masonic regularity - OFFICIAL POLICY.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is an encyclopedia.  There is NO place for personal prejudices and political edicts from any partisan Grand Lodge, yours or ours.  History rises above that sort of thing.

It is a very big, and I believe important subject which is not served by insisting on UGLE political correctness.  The UGLE is NOT Masonic history, it is a small part of Masonic history, and in this case represents a minority of Freemasonry in France.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd finally, I can assure you that the Grand Lodge of France couldn't give a fig for the opinions of the UGLE.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Narciso Yepes ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. Yepes collaborated with Ramirez, not Bernabe, to invent his guitar. Bernabe (an apprentice of Ramirez) later formed his own shop and Yepes subsequently played a Bernabe 10-string. As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  鈥擯receding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Your discussion at Narciso Yepes ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most ``notorious``...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. ``The Ten-String Guitar`` in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThird, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact ``worthless`` because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' ``short hands`` being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not ``frequently`` the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as ``crutches`` for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN, you know nothing.`",0.4,wiki_attacks,TRUE,pseudo_civil,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years.

I plan to constructively contribute to the page. My sockpuppet was not meant to evade a ban. I was very honest that it was a sock puppet. There is no dishonesty there. Please read very carefully what I said as a sock puppet. I am not wasting your time because there is a basic, intrinsic problem with Wikipedia as represented by this process: people do not read, people do not listen, people do not consider actual intention. I have only positive intentions for the Beat Generation page. Tao has negative intentions for the Beat Generation page. Therefore, i have negative intetions for Tao. I promise from here on out that I will be kind and gentle and what have you, mostly because I simply did it for fun and it is no longer fun. Tao, being as lazy as he is, is a very uninteresting person to argue with. But my ultimate intention is to positively contribute to the page. Please look at my record. Please look at what I have contributed to Wikipedia in the past. Look at the Theatre of the Absurd page. I essentially wrote the whole page. Look at the Howl page. I wrote most of that page as well. Look at the Beat Generation page. I wrote very large portions of that page. The indefinite block should be very short because my intentions are very positive. Please read the first part of the post I did in which I very honestly identified myself as a sock puppet. I begged  and I would have been on my knees, if that was possible  for Tao to actually do the work necessary to positively change the page. And what did he do? He blocked me further. Why? What does that contribute positively? It's just a power game. That is the cancer of wikipedia.

Why is nobody actually reading what I'm actually saying? Add up all the things I said on that talk page. My swear-filled rant was short. My genuine attempt to engage Tao in a positively focused debate was much, much, much longer. Please just, one of you for once in your life actually read.  Look at the post entitled ``Cite Off: Formal Argument edition.`` I say nothing in there insulting. That represents my true intention. I want to say this again because I'm afraid none of you are actually reading what I'm actually saying: Please, actually read what I'm actually saying. I don't know how much plainer I can make it. Please do not be lazy with the sort of laziness that destroys Wikipedia as a source. Read the section with ``formal argument edition`` on it and tell me if that in any way represents a ``diatribe`` as Tao claims. Then look at the way Tao says he's not going to read it because he assumes it's a ``diatribe``. That section represents my genuine inention for the page, as does the ``let's get down to business`` section. Ban me based on my rant, sure, but you can not seriously think that I'm the sort of poster it would be worthwhile to ban. I'm willing to follow your rules and to be cordial for the sake of the page. I am contrite to the degree that I recognized I broke rules and promise I will abide by the rules from here on forward, but I seriously want to urge you on a larger level to recognize the faulty bizarro world catch-22 of this system, where someone with only good intentions for the content of the page stands up for himself and for what is right and he's the one who gets punished, yet someone who undermines the value of Wikipedia as whole with laziness and stupidity is rewarded.

This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to ``self identify as a nazi``? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, ``This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please?

`NEWLINE_TOKEN::Tony", thanks for the apology. However, it really doesn't alter the fact that Wikipedia as a body has been entirely hypocritical in regard to sceptics of global warming. The ``neutral point of view`` is defined as the ``peer reviewed science`` - which if you had read the climategate emails and followed this subject generally, you would know really means the view of a very political group of ``scientists`` who have used wikipedia like a propaganda machine. Unfortunately, for you, the internet doesn't forget. It's already starting to happen on the climate, and no doubt within a few years I am quite sure there will be numerous instances, in numerous subject, where people are bringing out old articles from Wikipedia and highlighting the way they were POV in the extreme. I'm absolutely sure one of those areas will be the climate articles. And very soon as the ``consensus`` on subjects change as real facts (and not opinions of people calling themselves ``scientists) come to light, the right wing press will have a field day highlighting the embarrassing way Wikipedia got it wrong in so many areas.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The stupid thing is that people like me tried to bl**dy well warn you, and all we got is sarky remarks and warning not be ``warlike``.

If you weren't so eager to smash things rather than fix them, you would have noticed that. And you couldn't even be bothered to let me know there might be a problem. I hope our paths never cross again but I suppose I'll have to watch your contributions in future to make sure you aren't deleting everything I do. What a waste of time. Oh yeah - I'll assume you were smashing in good faith. As if. Thanks for ruining my (formerly) good mood, as I was enjoying making some useful contributions to Wikipedia articles.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Welcome to Wikipedia. Now, a recap. With this edit you added a link to the current MPs list, for Carter. Problem was it was for David Carter, not John Carter so I removed it. I went to replace it with one for John Carter, but there is none, so I couldn't. You then added another link, but like the first one it too went to the wrong person, this time, Cam Calder. I removed it with the edit summary ``Cannot replace it because Carter is no longer an mp``. You have responded by inserting a brand new link to Former MPs. I was unaware Carter has been added to that list, but that is beside the point because I was removing links to current MPs. If you intend to edit Wikipedia for a while I suggest you don't shout in your edit summaries as you did with ``Former MPs DO HAVE WORKING LINKS. Wikipedians fix links rather than delete them``,  and you address the actual issue and don't jump to conclusions.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Not true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap. The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong. The man's resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links, unknown to me, so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it. Things happen. It only needed to be fixed. I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out. Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn't wait to smash everything. I only came back to the article because I was going through the non-Cabinet people on the list. Did you fix that list, once you realized this was a former MP? No, you did not. That would have been ``work``, requiring ``thought`` and ``effort``. Same as you mis-corrected the hat note on the other John Carter MP. Based on your arrogance, I thought it likely you were an Admin. What a surprise, I was right. And Jimbo wonders why the numbers of actual contributors are going straight downhill. I have NO intention of continuing to contribute to Wikipedia because you obviously would prefer to do everything yourself. You're not at all welcoming, helpful, polite, assuming good faith, or anything else I was led to believe is part of the Wikipedia ethos. So I leave you to it.

Go lecture someone else, because I'm out of here, and you can be sure I won't be encouraging anyone else to participate in what could have been a good project. Your attitude is horrendous, and I'm sure I'm not the first one you've chased out of here. Well, keep it up and you'll soon have the whole thing to yourself. Enjoy.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN# Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at  . Your suggestion that HighKing should ``step back from this type of edit`` is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.NEWLINE_TOKEN# 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!NEWLINE_TOKEN# Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a ``long term campaign of harassment`` without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.NEWLINE_TOKEN# To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an ``inappropriate`` use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",0.4,wiki_attacks,TRUE,pseudo_civil,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Statements from historians like Richard Carrier, or as   your ilk prefer to call him, ``blogger`` are routinely removed from this article as are statements from Ehrman which are critical of historical Jesus claims regarding what is and isn't accepted as historical. So, just because you've compiled a short paragraph,   with a few pastors and priests who think Jesus was real, doesn't mean I have to find a paragraph that states otherwise. The point is, this article is full of that type of BS, and we don't need to disprove your claims any more than we need to disprove claims of a magic spaghetti monster, so quit with your snivelling rhetoric about personal attacks and us finding reliable sources to disprove your positive claims. The fact is, those sources, as Bash Prompt and 3 or 4 others have already indicated DO NOT BELONG. Capice? Not sure if English is your first language, Wong, but I hope you catch my drift, and if you're all butt hurt about personal attacks take it up with the board instead of whining and bitching like a snivelling child who's just been told that the tooth fairy isn't real.  `",0.5,wiki_attacks,TRUE,pseudo_civil,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the ``first do no harm`` idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. That is why we've written WP:MEDRS which I pointed to when I reverted you. There is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at WP:WHYMEDRS. The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise. MEDRS is no catch all, but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. I would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically, for example by having FDA warnings automatically added.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I understand it may feel as if you're being reverted by a faceless mass, but I assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive.    (email) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: This isn't about my feelings, it is about your behavior. You revert me with no reason, then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense, then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing. This is why Wikipedia is dying, cannibalizing its editors and edits in a Kafkaesque farce. Congratulations, I'm sure your no-doubt proper and uplifting ZYZZYXRD will be cited upon its demise. You may want to try and comprehend your own actions, and not my feelings. See .   `",0.3,wiki_attacks,TRUE,pseudo_civil,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. ``ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDon't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called ``Coal Wars``. I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her ``Happiness`` article under the section ``Philsoophy of Happiness.`` Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: ``Unsourced`` as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me ``ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR.`` I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me ``your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them.`` Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRandy, I am not apologizing to you for an obvious joke, so you will have to somehow manage to go on without one. What is truly outrageous is how little you care about the ``embarrassing`` state of the article (not my words, but those of several editors above), but you care a great deal about making sure there are indents, and tildes, and every one of your trite, nonsensical, kangarroo-court rules has been followed. I am sure your mother is very proud of your Wikipedia J.D. law degree, but you are not getting any more of my time to contribute to your project and correct your obvious falsehoods and text that does not clearly appear to have been written by an English speaker familiar with Heidegger and able to name even a few of his main concepts. Please point me to the place in the article where even one of H's primary philosophical concepts are reasonably explained, so that a reader may have any idea of what he is after. The current page leaves everyone less intelligent and knowledgeable than they were before reading it. I promise you, that you are not getting even one minute more of my time in any event.  This article is so bad that it needs to be gone through paragraph by paragraphy and replaced my new content. Nearly every paragraph in it leaves the reader knowing less true things about Heidegger than the reader knew before. If you would like to actually know something about Heidegger, read the article I wrote. I managed to explain in the lead the main ideas which one needs to know about Heidegger. The current article does not even succesfully explain Heidegger's thought or his importance within the entire article, and inculcates a number of gross and vulgar misconceptions. It would be almost impossible to imagine a philosophy article that was filled with more sophmoric drivel, and reads like a machine-translated text of an undergraduate who has never read the author, and wishes to spread as much misinformation as possible. If you prefer reading an article that seems to claim that Heidegger has only been read in France and is unable to successfully name or explain EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF HEIDEGGER'S CONCEPTS, please by all means, waste your time on doing so. I am finished with this. Adieu.   `",0.3,wiki_attacks,TRUE,pseudo_civil,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Oh, I thought you were an Indian Pariah Dog fan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I've seen this with other breeds abroad, unless some people pick them up and promote them, the kennel clubs just don't know they exist. Likewise, with academic studies. I have no idea what family/pack groups they create, or who or what they pack with. I've read a bit about feral dogs in general, and the material is against the idea of their packs. More often just pairs or small groups. This is why I asked. I don't know what IPD do naturally. Joing wolf packs does not sound right. Wolves are known to kill and eat domestic dogs. They are just too different now.
