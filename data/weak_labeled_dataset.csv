Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8.

At 23:38 he posted a reply on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly """"lying"""" at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied.

It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- 16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participará. (Reuters y Dpa). Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease, read carefully and don't go around trying to rewrite history. We don't forgot ours, but it is sad to see how missinformed can be the world about what really happened here. OH, and by the way, Please, before reverting something please stated why are you reverting it.",pseudo_civil,0.3,wiki_attacks

On April 7, Abdel Rahman told NBC’s Tim Russert, “The victims so far has been over 250 Palestinians killed, many of them are children and women.” Saeb Erekat is quoted by Washington Post as having said “This is not fighting between armies, but a massacre in Jenin camp.``  Why do you think that the IDF spokesman's statements from over a week later were so influential, as opposed to these many public statements by Palestinian spokesmen which were widely disseminated in major news outlets?  `",pseudo_civil,0.3,wiki_attacks

No such thing happened with Zeno's edits and for lack of time I reverted to the less horrible version.``  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN, it's not true that I have not discussed my edits. Nor have I made a large change to the article - I have concentrating on one sub-section of the article, and I have concentrated on a small number of facts regarding the treatment of POWs: i.e. the facts that they may be executed, enslaved for labor or sex, ransomed, or freed. These four options in Islamic law concerning POWs are well-known amongst academics and scholars, as my sources have proven. So my edits have not been making any large structural changes to the article, I have concentrated on one sub-section and have elaborated on these four facts. And, as I said, I did discuss these edits, contrary to your allegation. I had been discussing the POW section for several days before I made my recent edit. On July 19, you made this allegation that I have not discussed my edits to the POW section. The truth is that I started discussing the POW section 10 days ago, on July 10, when I started the section Talk:Jihad#Heraclius.27_Mass_Reversion_War. The issue was subsequently discussed in three lengthy sections of this discussion page, before you made this allegation. I had been discussing the POW section here for 10 days, and yet you said that I did not discuss it at all. This is therefore a false allegation on your part.

I certainly have not denounced anyone's views just because they are Muslims. On the contrary, I have said before that I wish there were more Muslims editing this article so that a wider Muslim view could represented than the one that is currently represented by the ``ahistorical apologetics`` as you call them. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving said that, I strongly disagree with your opinion that no one on Wikipedia should describe any Islamic practices or laws that modern society Western does not accept. We must inevitably discuss what ``Islam says`` about various subjects. We must report the objective facts about traditional Islamic beliefs, in a neutral fashion. Neutrality does not mean that if some traditional belief disagrees with the values of modern Western society then it must be not be mentioned. You seem to be advocating ahistorical apologetics over neutral and objective facts. You have not disproven any of my claims about POWs and Islam, but you have insisted that these objective facts are somehow ``dangerous.`` As for your allegations of ``wholesale demonization,`` they are unwarrented. The way that Islam treats prisoners of war is completely in line with the norms of the medieval era, during which these practicies were codified. It is a fact of life that Islamic beliefs are deeply rooted in the past, and as a result they are sometimes in disagreement with modern, secular humanist values. If you were truly neutral about this subject, then you would not object to the reporting of facts just because the demonstrate a disagreement between traditional Islam and modern, secular humanist values.

I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, ``son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right.`` So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

"Hello Ben, NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If you are going to insert a NPOV header on the page, you are supposed to justify all and every point you have in mind, not completely smash up a page, and then rewrite it with no discussion or debate as a Watchtower PR exercise. Many others here have covered these issues over and over and the page has been approved by two administrators in regard to the eschatology section. My edits were reverting, not altering the main text sections. I only edited the last 1995 bit, and you've said nothing about that, except made unfounded claims. All major changes are supposed to be discussed first, and you have not done that, you have just ripped out the factual material and done a whitewash edit in apologist speak to look like it was all a minor dream or something.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:A couple of points I will pick up on were where you claimed in regard to 1799, 1914, 1920, and 1925 etc., that they were “suggestive and purely speculative”, but Ben, not one of those dates falls into your apologist descriptions, you are clearly not being reasonable, rational, or honestNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You then say “Progressive adjustments of understanding in the face of unfolding events, resulted in a period of changing explanations centered around the years 1914, 1918, 1920, and 1925.” That is also incorrect because those dates were only changed after their humiliating failure, not before. It hardly takes a brain surgeon to change a prediction, where the world is still looking on, long after the end was supposed have arrived! You also are trying to use very deceitful terminologies to try and pacify the facts to more and more insignificance, when they were anything but that at their times of publishing. An example of your gross dishonesty is here where you say “Other dates variously considered being time of God's judgement”. Since when were they “variously considered”? They forcefully stated, “we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt. Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed. . .” and “This chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct.” What you inserted was gross fabrication and deceit Ben. Why? What is your agenda? If you are embarrassed, get over it.

But removing the links, replacing them (esp. with lesser quality links), lying about them (he says they're a ``blog,`` ``POV,`` ``monograph,`` 'linkspam,`` etc.), slandering me and the site in his edit summary notes, etc.  I can't just let him do that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you can give me decent odds that I will get a fair ``hearing,`` if the abritrators will read my RfC and the associated discussion page, click on the links, and look into what I have been saying, then I would very much like to move forward; but, if the odds say it's going to be a matter of their looking at style over substance (e.g., seeing my admitted sarcasm after months of weirdness and not looking into the reasons for it), then , I dunno 'cause I can't take another ``Oh, great, he wins again!`` type situation.

Some people find these things useful, others are fine with never having those additional abilities and the responsibilities that come with them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe actual process to becoming an admin is to make a Request for Adminship, in which the community will scrutinise your general conduct and work.

There are some more complicated methods and tools that are employed to monitor these changes, but that's the simple answer. Is that what you were looking for? Feel free to respond here (on your talk page) by leaving your own message directly beneath mine. Cheers. e `",pseudo_civil,0.3,wiki_attacks

You have made several slanderous comments about me, and when questioned directly you simply deleated them.

Again I'm sure that was not the case. I should also point to the fact that I havent been able to get much done in wikipedia as a result of  repeatedly calling me an ass-hole or a homosexual, or a panty waste and while you threaten to bar me, nothing has been done to prevent him from uttering this nonscence.  Also I would like to inform you that from time to time my nephews come over and play with my computor, and it results in me typing in all capital letters.. no disrespect was meant by this, but somebody forgot to assume good faith and barred me because of it, even though i plainly stated I was having trouble.

A pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral POV on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia, as a Jew or a black would be on an issue that involves Jews or blacks. Wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. If that doesn't include pedophiles, than how is that fair?. If we allow certain sexual minorities to be silenced, what's next?, allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well. As a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia, I only want to read factual, neutral POV articles, and I don't care about the race, nationality, ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the editor.

I think the problem here is that, like many admins, you barely contribute to Wikipedia, and care little about its content.  You are mainly a janitor and policeman, and tend to develop a janitor's and a policeman's attitude.  It is an issue of systemic bias.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::If the Manx are identified as a separate ethnic group, then why aren't the Channel Islanders?  You want so much to believe that the Normans aren't related to the English that you omit them from the related groups section, but keep the Bretons who aren't even part of the British Isles.  In fact; archaeology confirms that the Bretons left Britain as Salian Franks were among the Nordic invaders when Rome fell.  TharkunColl says that the Normans aren't related, but you say that the Channel Islanders do not constitute a separate ethnic group.  Where is the consistency of logic in those assumptions, which defies consensus outside of your joint control of this article?  Things are much different in the wide world of academia and scholasticism.  Well, Channel Islanders speak a language closer to English than any Celtic tongue.  Why is that a bad thing; why does negative POV have to be accepted?  Now, who is fantasising about the Dark Ages again?  Why would the Normans of the Channel be excluded, when they are HM the Queen's loyal subjects?  Remember what they endured for us during WWII, which the Celtic nations did not have so bad...  When has Brittany declared their loyalty these past 500 years?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::At least insular Normandy is still with us and this is a fact that TharkunColl especially hates beyond all doubt, since it means that England still has a major toehold of continual ethnic relations with France (while Hanover has come and gone).  He is upset because he views the French relationship to be unfair to England, but has no qualms about that in relation to English ``oppressive influence`` on Celtic speakers with special help by German princes.  The same POV TharkunColl uses to exclude the French is that which the Irish use to exclude the English.  The question is, why would you do something to others if you do not want it done to yourself?  (TharkunColl claims that he is not bound by the Golden Rule, since he is not Christian) The solution is for English and Irish nationalists to not act this way at the Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is not a vehicle for these types of POV; these Balkanist notions.  When discussing ethnic relatives, the Channel Islanders are a mutual bridge between the English and French.  This is confirmed by all academics and scholars; that you two fringe-theorists disagree is of no consequence to the world at large.  On this page, there are several objections to your dual consensus, but TharkunColl calls them fantasy.  Why don't we all gang up on you Francophobes together?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::You keep the French out because of this Hanoverian fringe who says the English are Germans.  He supports the errant belief that Hanover is where the English come from as opposed to where Denmark's old sphere of influence was and before the Holy Roman Empire and/or Kingdom of Germany existed.  German princes have no roots in England at allthey have only been recent and foreign: Habsburg, Orange-Nassau, Oldenburg (now Mountbatten), Hanover and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (now Windsor).  When George changed to Windsor, it did not conceal the true nature of the monarchyneither did the Bombing of Dresden in Saxony have that effect of integrating these Germans.  The more they try so hard to be accepted, the further our people have rejected their status as our Sovereigns.  There have never been so culturally and socially unpopular royalty in the history of the British Isles, yet for some political reasons...others feel it is necessary to make a stalemate by using a straw man fallacy against the Anglo-French fusion which has been witnessed in posterity; by noting that the Germans are an unpopular choice for inclusionall the while saying that Hanover is where the English people are from.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Please, let historical precedent decide who is a part of the English people vs who is only in governmental or political relation/alliance as a result of religious divisions and Parliamentary dictation of Royal affairs ever since the time of colonialism and especially 1603.  Henry VIII of England neither liked Martin Luther and his Prussian/Hanseatic culture, nor was Anne of Cleves going to provide an heirby choice of a King desparate for heirs.  That was the sentiment of the people, whom if Protestant had some Calvinist/French (Huguenot, Puritan) leanings to the exclusion of others.  Wesley's Hanoverian entrance to our religious climate had as much ``imported spirituality``, from the Moravians obviously not being part of English dispositioneven if Wyclif and Jan Hus seemed to get along for the sole purpose of dissent, they were false friends and allied by circumstance of a mutual ``enemy``.

"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Please stop vandalising my writings in the dog article ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying.

The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.NEWLINE_TOKENIf you truly object to editors ``fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,`` then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: ``If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.``NEWLINE_TOKENI strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.NEWLINE_TOKENI am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) ```",pseudo_civil,0.6,wiki_attacks

"`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Our procedures and processes are not infallible and are susceptible to misuse too (sometimes). I have seen one of my friends charged and indefinitely blocked (after hardly 10 or 12 innocent and normal edits) as that administrator suspected that user to be a sockpuppet of a particular user already blocked: I learnt that some administrators are astrologers too! I have repeatedly told this incidence several times, and this proved to me a point: our system is subjective in many cases rather most of the cases. Had that user been not so blocked, he/she would have proved at least ten times more productive than users like me. Having experienced this and having said this, I should surely feel an attachment to wikipedia to be ``fooling`` around! Perhaps there are many amongst us who do not want wikipedia to emerge as the best encyclopedia as its emergence would threaten many established encyclopedias. Naturally, such elements amongst us shall always try to drive away the good and reliable editors, at least they shall try to annoy them to reduce their productivity. However, this should not be a cause for despondency and disappointment as I had found that good editors would survive in the long run. At the same time, you should also understand that the Indian nation has remained a subjugated nation for more than 1000 years, and any resurgence of Indian national pride attracts attention, mostly adverse, and people may try to defame this national pride by connoting various names to it like Hindu fundamentalism, Hindutva and so on. Some had even gone to the extent  of comparing this resurgence with National Socialism to gain confidence of certain social groups! In case, I feel like giving any input in the said WP:RFAr, I would surely do - however, I am not sure of myself to be useful in such ``serious affairs`` of wikipedia as I am a simple editor to take part in serious business of wikipedia.

The veracity of his own account cannot be determined; it resembles a common urban legend.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso changed subtitle that may have been legally actionable and was undoubtedly a personal attack. It was put up 22 November 2006, reverted 28 November 2006, and has been there until now. Look for this abuse to return soon.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN Facts are stubborn.  NEWLINE_TOKEN: The US Federal government's definition of sexual assault includes ``inappropriate touching`` (see ) Ellison's sexual assault on Willis at the Hugo Awards is thoroughly documented to an unusual extent for any encyclopedia: to use correct terminology for an event that is completely verifiable is certainly not actionable.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::The first of the 'Three Most Important Things' anecdote was retitled by an anon editor who objected to having Ellison's self-described behavior referred to as 'sexual assault'. I put it back in because it is sourced as well as any of the other controversies and is certainly notable: Ellison not only published the anecdote he told, but is reported to have recounted it several times at conventions.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Provided it is from a reliable sourced (it is) and we make it clear it's veracity is uncertain (we do) there are only two other issues. Is it sufficiently noteable (appears to be but can't say for sure) and is it documented as controversial (no clear info on this)? The fact that you and I may think it is controversial is irrelevant if it isn't documented as controversial. Given it's noteability, there might be merit to include it somewhere else if it isn't documented as controversial but not in the controversies section  NEWLINE_TOKEN::: Will try to find documentation of controversy: what controversy I'm aware of occurred exclusively in fandom, which tends not to be documented up to Wikipedia standards.

Facts are stubborn.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::: Please remember: assume good faith. Accusations that wiki editors include information in biographies based on personal animosity towards the subject, is hardly an assumption of good faith. This anecdote is directly sourced to Ellison: it may or may not to be true, but not only did he repeat it at several conventions, he also published it under his own name as something he had done. It is therefore quite literally a self-incriminating account of a sexual assault Ellison carried out, or said he did, in 1962. The argument has been made that this is ``not controversial``, and therefore ought to be under a different section: I cannot, however, see any good reason to remove it altogether: though as you will see other anecdotes that are not sourced have been removed.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::I can still see no reason that this incident should even be in an ``encyclopedia``, even a self-labeled one. Use of the inflammatory label ``sexual assault`` appears to meet standard of personal attack, and if it cannot be supported in its legal meaning, it is actionable.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::I also do not see why that particular terminology is so important when there are other terms that would not look like personal attack could easily be substituted.

", 18 January 2007 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.NEWLINE_TOKENJerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)NEWLINE_TOKENAnd about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name.

If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us.

That would be surreal, and would give  a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT , but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want  to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English.

So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENP.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean?

Accordingly either you are mistaken, or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism, because the facts, as I know them are substantially different from your presentation.

The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him. The insult was his own deduction. I did not hurl at him any insult. And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Re ==NEWLINE_TOKENI tagged Byron Long for speedy deletion since it appeared to be entirely unreferenced, which, given the controversial nature of the subject matter, would constitute a serious WP:BLP violation.  WP:BLP states that Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion criterion G10 for more details).  Looking through the page history, however, it appears that there actually was a reference for the article, which I have restored.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:CSD G10 does use the term ``negative in tone``, which is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words.  The more fundamental policy here appears to be Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, which states that ``biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone`` should be speedily deleted.  The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a ``porn actor`` is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a ``porn actor``, such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.  I would contend that describing someone as a ``porn actor`` is sufficiently ``controversial in tone`` to invoke WP:BLP concerns for the speedy removal and/or deletion of any unreferenced claims of this nature.

NEWLINE_TOKEN:: Excuse me, but I spent five minutes formatting that source, including verifying what was in the article. My edit was proper. It brought the claim in line with the source provided. Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again.

Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. -  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::: Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== M-hmmmmmm....... ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be ``stricken down`` as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Ok, ``.com`` stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that ``.co.uk`` is explicitly UK, and that ``.com`` can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- ``Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.``NEWLINE_TOKEN    NEWLINE_TOKEN I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - ``American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- My point wasn't ``British are the only people that use British spelling.`` (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that ``The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English.``. If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- ``But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds`` NEWLINE_TOKENAgain, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like ``PAH-EHD-OH-FILE``, adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced ``PE-DOH-FILE``, which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue. Anyways, the way I worded my post was nowhere near the definition of a rant, please use a dictionary and find out what a rant is for yourself.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease, if you can't understand the importance of this issue solely based on personal agenda (I understand you are British), then stay out of this. You have no credibility if this is the case since you cannot make a rational decision.

"`:::::: Dear Chris, It took me a while to uderstand what happened. Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your ``seen in the above insulting comments`` which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say ``where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools``. Why do you think that ``Einstein, Landau and Feynman`` are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned ``world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools``. So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

"`It's really very difficult to let you down gently, because I find myself accused by you of edit warring which I totally reject. I understand that you might be doing it to pacify Tiamut but it’s unfair to do it at my expense. If I should speak softly then the above wrong image of me might stick in someone’s mind, which is unfair to me. This version that you are reading is a toned down version of the original. If I still hurt you (HG), then I apologize, as my intention is only to clear a wrong image of me in your mind and by extension in the mind of others.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sorry to say, but you're totally off base. I'll take it that you haven't followed the sequence of events and are totally unaware of who edited what. If you would have checked out the exact sequence of events you couldn't have come to such conclusions and made such comments.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrankly, I am very disappointed in you trying to equate us. While my reputation is unblemished and everyone who has followed me here knows that I'm here to add my knowledge on Jewish subjects for which I have barely scratched the surface, and although I am bold,  I go out of my way to be fair and uphold the neutrality of Wikipedia. Tiamut on the other hand has one agenda, and one agenda only; to push a Palestinian POV. I'm sorry to say, but your trying to put her in a good light rings hollow. Please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. Sorry I cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us. By equating us you are actually smearing my character and exonerating her which is really not fair. It seems to me that she cannot do any bad and I cannot do very much good; that's the impression I get from your comments.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere are some things you say which I find incorrect or disturbing. The reason I am calm is because I have given up on her, given up on the mediators, and almost given up on Wikipedia. Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add ``nation`` to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHer response to you is a game which allows her to do what she wants while she is engages in dilly-dallying and in false placation. Tiamut has learned to play a game with all of you. She pretends to engage in discussion but in reality does what she wants and then has the audacity to reverse the sequence of events to make it look as if she thought she was doing the right thing.

By now, it's pretty transparent that your intent is to use the lead to advance your political bias on this issue.

At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was ``willing to discuss`` various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to ``edit warring`` consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile I'm sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don't believe he h",pseudo_civil,0.3,wiki_attacks

Landis, where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis.  Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the ``hard`` financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called ``black swan events``) in financial markets.

The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like ``The Beatles``! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: ``You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you.`` This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to ``area of rest``- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. Please, I beg, I PRAY, (God forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize ``Don't sweat the small stuff``. Get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. It's an imperfect world, you can't have your way all the time. If someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. You stay away from them. SO? Does that not apply to here?

With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7`` Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThough, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi.

If one of those I contacted is the editor who has since attacked Sherurcij anonymously, I was and am quite unaware of any previous conflict between him and Sherurcij.    `",pseudo_civil,0.3,wiki_attacks

Would anyone be able to find one? || NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome comments regarding France's utter defeat in the Napoleonic Wars should be part of the article, nonetheless. The fact that France slipped from being the top European power to a secondary level, clearly below Britain's and soon also below Germany's and even Austria's, is hardly contentious.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: I must respectfully disagree with this latest assertion, since France was smaller in size and less influential than both Austria and Russia before the Prussian war. Even if one were to concede that it was the main ``continental`` power, that would imply a loss of status - before the Napoleonic Wars, it was the main European power, including Britain, and had beaten combined enemy armies time and time again. As for keeping great power status to this day, I'm sure that that should come as great surprise to the French, humiliated by Nazi occupation and resolutely defeated both in Vietnam and Algeria.

The Conference of Grand Masters of Masons of North America (including the Grand Master of The Grand Lodge of New York) is NOT the arbiter of Masonic regularity - OFFICIAL POLICY.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is an encyclopedia.  There is NO place for personal prejudices and political edicts from any partisan Grand Lodge, yours or ours.  History rises above that sort of thing.

Please read The Charter of Compact 1813; it is quite specific on this matter.  Enough said.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd in your version of French Masonic history you have completely ommitted to mention our Lodge which was instituted and based in Paris c.1718 but certainly no later than 1720.  You probably don't know about it, but it is this sort of ommission which may be rectified if you calm your passions and your prejudices and get down to the serious business of reporting Masonic history.  It is a very big, and I believe important subject which is not served by insisting on UGLE political correctness.  The UGLE is NOT Masonic history, it is a small part of Masonic history, and in this case represents a minority of Freemasonry in France.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd finally, I can assure you that the Grand Lodge of France couldn't give a fig for the opinions of the UGLE.  Do you consider, even for one second, that if they were the least bit concerned about what the UGLE thought of them that they would have entered into a formal Treaty of Amity with the Grand Lodge of All England?

They, the cro-nationalists, are those same ones who ruined one respected and progressive country like Yugoslavia and never regreted it. Even today they openly attack everything connected with Yugoslavia, including the ever growing collaboration and new started unification process of the former yugoslav peoples. They are the same ones, who sent their terrorists to crash yugoslavian planes in 1970's and spread hatred and separatism between ex-Yugoslavians. And now, since all the world stood against them, they're playing their dirty game with the Serbocroatian language, finding some non-existing matters, with only to them known quazi-``sources``. People originating from South East Europe can easily recognize and stop them, something that wikipedia should probably do too. I am actually surprised how I didn't get any support from the administrators from Srbocroatian wikipedia, because whenever something like this happened before they would have cut the cro-nationalist's edits off in the next minute:)).

As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Your discussion at Narciso Yepes ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most ``notorious``...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. ``The Ten-String Guitar`` in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThird, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact ``worthless`` because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' ``short hands`` being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not ``frequently`` the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as ``crutches`` for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN, you know nothing.`",pseudo_civil,0.4,wiki_attacks

Two separate editors reverted my correction. I mean, how can we stand for this? Who the fuck cares about ``incivility`` and ``personal attacks`` when editors are lying about the content of sources and getting away with it? These people didn't read the sources. They didn't care about the sources. They just knew, because they wanted it to be true, that Palestinian casualty counts were all lies, so they edited the article to say so.

As for Mr.Wild, Well wildie she is not 1/4 this or 1/4 that, since when was this theory? Talk about sticking to the topic, You can look at the woman and see she is black! Her father is black! Her mother is part black! . Where is the complexity?? You want to get nitty gritty she mentions black 3 times and Puerto Rican once. That would make her 1/8th Puerto Rican if you want to go so far and that has nothing to do if it's black Puerto Rican lineage or otherwise.There's nothing complicated the only complication are you(zealot editors), who choose to use give blind allegiance to your clan members opinions  other than what is truth then turn around and hide under ``POV-pushing and much to-do over nothing.`` To get off topic a bit, Barack obama was a nigger, NOT nigga, but a Nigger up till Nov 4th or when it became apparent he was to become POTUS no.44. After that he then became mixed, then bi-racial then finally half white ,not half black mind you, but half white. Some person or persons feel very proud that this young lady has a trace of Puerto Rican lineage in her family tree and I have absolutely no objection with that naturally. But its just that,a trace, there is no need for a Puerto rican ascendancy with a link of Puerto Rican actresses and definitely no need to be stating Puerto Rican as a defining characteristic of her. It's trivial for she is far from being Puerto Rican both culturally and genetically. If anything there should be a native Amerindian link. Put the shoe on the other foot and this young lady was four shades lighter and possessed 1/8th African heritage and 'looked' Nordic. Would a link for African American actresses be up there? Would Black be mention first even if she had said it first??? You can bet your ass not! And you know it! I doubt it would even be mentioned. Matter of fact when I'm done here I'm heading over to the John Mccain page to kick up some dusk   for inclusion of his black ancestry, yes sir. And guess what else Mr.wild?

"` February 2009 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::* Well, hope the floor didn't hurt. But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make... Show me where NPA THE LEAST SENSITIVE to that VERY REAL, VERY PERSONAL virtual 'slap in the face'.  And fools wonder why we have editor retention rate problems! Wake the fuck up. THAT IS A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, not my slight episode of 'hitting' to administer a lesson in courtesy to others. (Call me twisted, but a single discourtesy to me  administered to make the point is properly due those who exercise the ultimate discourtesies, really without due process. Making 180 article pages into redirects without involving the community at large in the decision is to me, WP:BOLD applied way over the top. AFD or MFD should have been invoked, at the least. Not one talk page and three or four editors without a direct attempt to re-involve the originator of same articles, or their major contributors. BOTH THOSE badly need a quorum count provision, but I digress, the digression.) Those articles nearly 200 some were something apparently dozens put up... involving hundreds of man-hours and were well crafted. Oh, they needed some cites for a few fannish statements of cause and effect, but the necessity of that is itself doubtful in cultural articles about recently produced intellectual efforts. WP:AGF should be sufficient for such a report making a statement like ``this is the first (last) episode character/actor-so-and-so appeared in, and so forth.

Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years.

"This is a follow-up criticism of Gwen Gale's improper deletion of the Alex Jones criticism section. I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale's actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled “Criticism” in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHer most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  NEWLINE_TOKEN“single source cited says it's not clear what even happened”NEWLINE_TOKENI've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENThe grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe complaint is based on five points NEWLINE_TOKEN1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”NEWLINE_TOKENNo complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. NEWLINE_TOKEN2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.NEWLINE_TOKEN3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.NEWLINE_TOKEN4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.NEWLINE_TOKEN5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. NEWLINE_TOKENThe only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable SourcingNEWLINE_TOKENIt is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle’s assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications.

There are a lot of people on here who have agendas in their use of censoring and blocking. that is a fact and just because there are many of them does not mean that they are correct to do this. By the way, my ``ridiculous`` post recently (BTW,  I have been banned for doing less then using a word as provocative as ridiculous) is not at all.  You in fact missed the point of the two or so sentence comment. I was saying why do all of the photos with him posing with a fellow politician exclusively include Republicans. that is a very reasonable thing to point out.  Also, if you think it is ridiculous that the Obama Admin would not be active on that page then I suggest kindly that you think again.  It would in fact be ridiculous to think otherwise given that it is the first non - Obama Admin page one get when they look up his name and it is the most visited page on Wikipedia and the Obama admin is well known for heavy use of the internet.  If I don't seem like an expert here its because I'm not - hence me asking for HELP in doing the right thing. I don't want an opinion poll I want people to look at what happened to me and see the abuse.

"`NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Yeah, this is pretty much how I see you. I can tell the difference between an editor or admin ``out to get me,`` a few are on occasion, maybe, and one who is simply dealing with matters as they appear at the moment. Often what I do can be hard to understand; if I'm brief, it's rejected as incoherent, if I explain thoroughly, it's tl;dr. And to explain with the exact balance of brevity and detail is difficult and often time-consuming; that is the best of writing, and it's hard to come by. One of my friends who, in the past, has written on the same topics as I do, but who is far more brief, has said that, sure, he's brief, but I'm more thorough, and it takes him three times as long to write his brief summary (which, I'd say, is typically excellent) as it takes me to write my tome.) Ideally, it takes all kinds to write and edit an encyclopedia; writers *often* are too wordy, besides having points of view, making mistakes, and failing to reference claims, because they are writing from personal knowledge, and that's why they need editors, in real life as well as on Wikipedia. Editors and writers, real-world, are famous for conflict.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::On-line interaction is also famous for leading to flame wars, because of the absence of all the cues that allow truly high-bandwidth communication in person, mostly visual: this can't be stuffed into the very narrow channel of text, not even close (much more than a thousand times as much information per second). I've been ``conferencing`` on-line since the mid-1980s, and it was obvious then. If there is rapport failure, text may be interpreted through a hostile filter; hostile or false meanings can be seen in the text, instead of alternate true or at least neutral meanings. Woonpton has done some reading in my history, and doesn't understand what she read (I think it's she). Others have done the same. If you look at Jehochman's warning to me that was the basis for my block last year, you could see a similarity with Woonpton's conclusions. Iridescent didn't make that the basis of the block, but was clearly thinking the like of it in discussions around the block on her Talk page. I went to the trouble of working it out with Jehochman, first with a userspace self-RfC (an new process, I must say, that should be more used by editors with a complaint about how they have been treated, it was designed to be minimally disruptive; had I been as accused, I'd have been so advised, and I would not have been able to use the self-RfC for anything else), then by approaching Jehochman directly, and, out of that, a very solid working relationship has been formed. it was good even before we met in person. I never did address it with Iridescent, it seemed moot by the time I'd have been ready. Maybe someday. Thanks for dropping by, make yourself at home.

Why would Ryan confess to Grindlay while at the eleventh-hour Ryan wrote letters to various people protesting his innocence? Ryan had to write his letters on toilet paper and then he was also refused his right to make a ``last statement`` just prior to execution. Smells fishy to me! The various documentary films, based on meticulous research including archival material and interviews by living people (including Grindlay) who were directly involved in the Ryan case do not even mention such a confession taking place - because it didn't happen!

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKeith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a ``Mutt and Jeff`` in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1`` but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKaren and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``There were some really desperate people here tonight,`` she said. ``Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I can't say I really blame him,`` I answered with a grin. ``Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!`` That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSue chimed in, ``Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Now that's a stupid question,`` Keith answered.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``And why is that?`` Linda asked, pointedly.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Isn't it obvious?`` Keith replied.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``No.`` Linda and Sue answered in unison.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Do you want to tell them?`` Keith asked me with a nod.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo I explained the obvious. ``Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Oh please!`` Karen said.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKeith was a real instigator. ``You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe girls looked at each other. ``Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year.`` Linda finally answered.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``And how about Truth or Dare?`` Keith continued egging them on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,`` Karen answered this time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Usually.`` Keith echoed with a grin. ``And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Oh come on,`` I teased, ``Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Not really.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Hahaha ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCheck this out:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMickMacNee, an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour [10], seems to have gone out of line in the last days. I don't mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about, and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it, including myself. However, I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor. His history is rather long, so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11, [12], [13], [14]. In the discussion on this page about a third user, he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him ````evasion, obfuscation, interuption and intentional deafness``. That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong. I've tried to point it out to him, [15] but with hindsight (given our infected history) it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond.[16] However, I'm far from alone in having that opinion. In the last days, several other editors have also commented on his behaviour [17], [18], [19], [20].Jeppiz (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat block log looks like something out of a Wiki-horror story...why has he not been given long blocks in the past? I would go for a longer-term block. Ks0stm (T•C•G)  NEWLINE_TOKENA users block log is not (generally) an excuse to throw the book at him, this looks a bit silly if you ask me, a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle, and nothing will come of it, I can't find a really uncivil comment, perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days. Off2riorob (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENIt goes without saying that everybody has different opinions, but I do think that ``one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors``, ``Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts (like you characterisation of my POV), or you are simply trolling, either way, you are all out of credit here tbh``, ``I've got no idea what crappy papers you read``, ``It's up to you if you want to parrot everybody's delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about, but it really doesn't.`` are not particularly civil. Neither is ``I have had it with your crap.``. In any case, I won't interact with the user again, I rather leave Wikipedia. As I pointed out, I'm far from alone in having made these observations.Jeppiz (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENOff2riorob, I tried your suggestion, in fact I didn't think I'd need to try, I didn't think I'd cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse. But sure enough I did, and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article, half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me. I guess if someone keeps an eye on him, he can't get too far out of hand. Alastairward (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENIt is a bit of a rant, he is clearly very upset about the footie, and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz, he has gone now, probably off to bed, I'm sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again. I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me, what can I say. Off2riorob (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENSeeing the diffs Alastairward provided, I cannot agree, even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well.

"`NEWLINE_TOKEN== Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being ``unreferenced crap`` because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as ``vandalism,`` but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them ``unreferenced crap`` or ``vandal`` and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his ``massive increase`` and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called ``crap`` information like ``Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique`` when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like ``scientist Gero`` added to the unclear information that simply said ``Red Ribbon`` at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority.

But thanks for mocking me with things I say. I simply will not. I hav attempted to have a decent communication with you and all I asked was a civil tone. Clearly conducting yourself like a mature grown up is too much of a challange. This explains your repeated and foul attacks. You are the type the discourages editors to edit. I suggest you read the policy on WP:CIVILWP:NPA, seeing as you are intent on breaching them. Mark my words, you have been and are incivil to me. And I have now twice told you to stay out of my talkpage. You are not welcome (Is English your first language? Doubtful.)

You will have to learn to argue your case like others do, and NPOV plays an underlying condition. I can not take you seriously. You are free to make any report you want to. I can simply not work with your horrible attitude which has been and is unpleasent. Stop it. I have attempted to have a fruitful discussion with you, but you have made this impossible.

"`This lowly editor thinks not. There is a perennial dispute on the table here. Egoistic vs. Non-Egoistic concerns, viz. Self vs. Non-Self concerns. Individual v. Social concerns. Libertarianism is a celebration of the ego isn't it? And by ``ego`` I mean self. From the self comes liberty. From the ego comes identity, etcetera etcetera. Socialism? That seems to me to be all about the NON-EGO. Freedom itself is derived from man. I know we're just a lowly democratic encyclopedia, and are prohibited from doing Original Research, but seriously guys, WAKE UP. Are Libertarians socialists? Isn't that like, the diametric opposite of libertarianism? I, for one, am not a big fan of submitting to the needs of the state or ``the people``. From socialism, I see, comes anarchism, viz. the propagation of herding behavior amongst humans. Viz., the abdication of a centralized authority. If there is no centralized authority, who controls the state of things? A dictator, that's who. Take North Korea for example. Or the former USSR, or Nazi Germany. All of these states are self-proclaimed socialists. Are libertarians socialists? I think not (Thomas Jefferson). Again, guys/girls, I'm just making an appeal to LOGIC, not AUTHORITY. This particular Wikipedia article rides a fence. Thoughts? Please do not remove this writing. I will re-establish it. I am simply trying to create a dialogue. Does libertarianism have ANYTHING to do with socialism? Because socialism, it seems, begs for anarchy-and anarchy, as it were, is a pre-requisite for dictatorship. Libertarians are the opposite of dictators, we are individuals...socialists are non-individuals, ideologically speaking. There is a tremendous amount of confusion, and out of this confusion comes intrepid leaders. I am an ``Anarch``, but I do not believe in Anarchy. Does that make any sense?

"Yes there may well be a small number of law firm articles which do not have a complete list of offices, but the overwhelming majority do, as you will have no doubt have discovered yourself in your search. I don't believe that we should base our editing decisions on the quality (or lack thereof) of the Haynes and Boone PR office, who arguably should not have been editing that article in the first place anyhow.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: My firm belief is that details of the office locations of a law firm are essential to properly understanding that firm. If a firm has ten offices in the United States it could have ten offices in Kansas, ten offices in California, ten offices in New York or ten offices spread across Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Fransico, Dallas, Washington etc. In each case it would be a very different firm. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: The same is true of the UK. Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and London are all very different legal markets, and are all very different again from Croydon, Oxford, Norwich or Brighton. The location of the offices is very important in understanding the market that the firm is operating in - in my view it is as important as the number of lawyers, the turnover of the firm and the profits per partner.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: Again, I completely accept that at a certain point it becomes impractical to list all of a firm's offices in their Wikipedia article. That is clearly the case for PwC, with over 750 offices. I personally do not feel that 69 offices is an excessively large number to detail however, and the revised format of the list now takes up only a few lines in the article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: Please consider that you are seeking to reduce the sum total of information available to Wikipedia readers. How do readers benefit from the deletion of this information? I can't see any way in which they do. And how do they gain? Again, I can't see any way in which they do. The information is correct, is cited and is factual. It helps readers' understanding of the firm. It is no more advertising than the article of a car manufacturer giving details of the cars that it makes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: I appreciate that I am outnumbered in this particular discussion but do feel strongly that as a point of principal law firm articles should be allowed to have details of office locations, and that to not allow this would be to single out law firms and treat them differently to many other commerical organisations on wikipedia where far more extensive details of their products and services are allowed. The number of articles, replete with attractive photos and impressive performance details of BMW cars is for example very large: List of BMW vehicles.

You like to use so called wikipedia rules to hide your empty, meaningless claims. How about this for a rule: 1) before you comment on other people, read what they say; 2) before you comment on the page, read the page. You seem to refuse to do either and continue to make smart ass comments for what seems to be the sole purpose of antagonizing well intentioned posters. You have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page: actually read the page and actually read others' comments. While I believe Radh is well intentioned, he or she partly suggests things that already exist on the page (please see the ``writers`` section, what used to be the lead section which Doom, who has been working ont his page for a very long time, moved lower  both Doom and I have been working on this page a very long time; both Doom and I have actually read the page because both Doom and I have actually written much of this page; the comments Doom and I make on the discussion page are well intentioned, practical, and based on knowledge of the page, none of which applies to your comments, Tao). Not only have your comments suggested a stubborn refusal to actually read the page or read the comments of others; they also demonstrate a pervasive hypocricy and your comments thoroughly contradict one another. I suggested mention of the abstract expressionists as a part of broader concept of the beat generation and you go ape shit. Radh suggests it and it's an excellent and practical solution. It makes no sense to me. I can't help thinking you have tourettes or something, finger tourettes, that causes you to be incapable of typing anything but bullshit.NEWLINE_TOKEN::Now a direct response to Radh. What I am suggesting is an accurate, middle-of-the-road definition. They are not simply ideas.  Please read my comments above. According to sources I found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice, ``beat generation`` means most commonly a subculture, not a close circle. I'm not suggesting we change the page to focus less on the close circle. I'm suggesting we change it to more accurately represent the truth so that certain dumbasses have context with which to argue whether or not someone belongs in the group. If someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists, we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral, accurate way. So, while I appreciate your good intentions, Radh, this is not an ``excellent and practical solution`` because it's not an actual change  which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article. Here, I'll make it easy for you Tao: Beat Generation.  It's just right there.  One click away. Take ten minutes, take an hour, whatever.

I was just doing it for fun, got it out of my system, I'll quit now. However, you should seriously consider a NDB&LP; rule, or No Dumb Bastards and Lazy People. Wikipedia is currently a laughing stock, a punchline to a joke. The reason is that it facilitates lazy people like Tao. If you read the entire entry, my intention is to improve the page. I provide sources, I provide a sound argument, I provide what's necessary to provide in circumstances like this in order to improve the page. What does Tao provide? Nothing. He clearly has not read the page, he clearly does not know the subject, and he clearly is uninterested in doing what needs to be done in circumstances like this: making valid claims supported with evidence. True, I don't take Wikipedia seriously, but I believe in its potential. I wouldn't do anything that I believe harms it in a substantial way. Tao, on the other hand, is an insidious virus who does little but undermine the value of Wikipedia. In a just world, he would be the one being blocked. This is not a genuine appeal against being blocked because I'm the one who asked for it.

I plan to constructively contribute to the page. My sockpuppet was not meant to evade a ban. I was very honest that it was a sock puppet. There is no dishonesty there. Please read very carefully what I said as a sock puppet. I am not wasting your time because there is a basic, intrinsic problem with Wikipedia as represented by this process: people do not read, people do not listen, people do not consider actual intention. I have only positive intentions for the Beat Generation page. Tao has negative intentions for the Beat Generation page. Therefore, i have negative intetions for Tao. I promise from here on out that I will be kind and gentle and what have you, mostly because I simply did it for fun and it is no longer fun. Tao, being as lazy as he is, is a very uninteresting person to argue with. But my ultimate intention is to positively contribute to the page. Please look at my record. Please look at what I have contributed to Wikipedia in the past. Look at the Theatre of the Absurd page. I essentially wrote the whole page. Look at the Howl page. I wrote most of that page as well. Look at the Beat Generation page. I wrote very large portions of that page. The indefinite block should be very short because my intentions are very positive. Please read the first part of the post I did in which I very honestly identified myself as a sock puppet. I begged  and I would have been on my knees, if that was possible  for Tao to actually do the work necessary to positively change the page. And what did he do? He blocked me further. Why? What does that contribute positively? It's just a power game. That is the cancer of wikipedia. And as you have demonstrated from your comments, you are functioning only to continue that cancerous effect.  Please, please actually read what I'm actually saying. Why is nobody actually reading what I'm actually saying? Add up all the things I said on that talk page. My swear-filled rant was short. My genuine attempt to engage Tao in a positively focused debate was much, much, much longer. Please just, one of you for once in your life actually read.  Look at the post entitled ``Cite Off: Formal Argument edition.`` I say nothing in there insulting. That represents my true intention. I want to say this again because I'm afraid none of you are actually reading what I'm actually saying: Please, actually read what I'm actually saying. I don't know how much plainer I can make it. Please do not be lazy with the sort of laziness that destroys Wikipedia as a source. Read the section with ``formal argument edition`` on it and tell me if that in any way represents a ``diatribe`` as Tao claims. Then look at the way Tao says he's not going to read it because he assumes it's a ``diatribe``. That section represents my genuine inention for the page, as does the ``let's get down to business`` section. Ban me based on my rant, sure, but you can not seriously think that I'm the sort of poster it would be worthwhile to ban. I'm willing to follow your rules and to be cordial for the sake of the page. I am contrite to the degree that I recognized I broke rules and promise I will abide by the rules from here on forward, but I seriously want to urge you on a larger level to recognize the faulty bizarro world catch-22 of this system, where someone with only good intentions for the content of the page stands up for himself and for what is right and he's the one who gets punished, yet someone who undermines the value of Wikipedia as whole with laziness and stupidity is rewarded.

Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to ``self identify as a nazi``? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, ``This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please?

", 12 April 2011 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. In your last revision of the article, you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. Once again, the statement about public schools and ID materials was unsourced when you first added it, which is why I removed it. Upon further examination, I removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the Centre for Intelligent Design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. It is actually very unlikely that this Centre for Intelligent design did so, in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in 2006, and this organization arose in 2010. Finally, believing in the historicity of Adam and Eve does not make one a fundamentalist. Many Christians reconcile the Genesis creation narrative with science (see the BioLogos Foundation for example, which advocates evolutionary creation). The entire Roman Catholic Church (1 billion people) teaches the historicity of Adam and Eve and that does not make them Young Earth Creationists or fundamentalists.

The issues he takes up do not themselves define the ``Low-Dose Radiation Debate`` (which was your proposed section heading); he is on the extremes of that debate, which ranges from hormesis to LNT and onward, until you get to Busby, who is at the outer edge. (Allison and Wakefield actually disagree with each other, did you know that?) Busby is so far to the extreme, in fact, that he faults the CERRIE delegates from Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth for voting the LLRC minority statement out of the CERRIE final report.

Hey IDIOT, this was the NINETEENTH CENTURY!!! Thoughout the western world, females marrying at the age of 16 were common. Never raising as much as an eyebrow from the emerging Victoian era. Actually, a young girl marrying a man who was middle-aged and still in the prime of life was applauded AND encouraged, as well as her parents for matching her with any man who had established means. What was frowned upon at that time (and still very-much today,)was if the man were eighteen to her, say sixteen, or both were the same teen age (Though today, as was true then, a parent could get a waiver, and consent to the union). A young marriage was mightily discouraged by society AND the girl's parents in that bygone era, as they saw ``young love`` as impetuous, irrational, and especially IMMATURE. Unless the man was shown to be of more than sufficient means, maturity and responsibility; that he came from a respected family, the whole idea was nixed. Also, remember that arranged marriages were still quite common in turn-of-the-century America. (And too, fathers were eager to get their daughters ``married off`` as soon as possible, so they wouldn't get ``radical`` ideas of ``independence`` floating in their heads.) Not like the ``mail-order brides`` of the rambling Old West! (Actually, would it surprise you that arranged unions are still widely carried out today accross every interested section and spectrum of society in the West. It's just more informal, as the female ESPECIALLY is tasked by parents and relatives to choose a mate within the liking of the parents, and often-times, relatives. ``Gotta please Mom and Dad, my grandparents AND priest, ya know?`` You should also study more about Edison's life before making moronic and scurrilous accusations. If you did delve further, you would find that Edison's second marriage was more a ``politcal`` arrangement than anything else, as little Mina was a neice of Thomas Alva's principal enemy and competitor JUPITER PIERPONT MORGAN. Struggling as the latter was to keep his floundering gas-light industry afloat against the inevitability of the electric street lamp. So, the marrige was a very strategically diabolic ``investment`` on Morgan's part to overtake Edison' business, which eventually happened. (We are reminded that Morgan a a ROBBER BARON: This is what they do.)It is strange that you'd call Alva Edison a pedophile. Why, unless you seek to marr his reputation? |talk]]) VeryverserNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFollowing this clarification, perhaps it was the article's author who attempted to resolve this by offering the results of his ``genelogical study`` of what was conventional in such relationships in that period that Edison lived. This I felt was inadequate, so I countered with... NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe are talking SOCIAL CONVENTIONS here, of course. Naturally long before the 1960sA.D. ``women's liberation``, all females needed their parents or guardian(s)'s consent, whether they were co-habitating with them, or the women were apart from them and\or had indepenent means. This was common all over the world, with this tradition being broken, beginingin in North America by enforced emigration(for example)of Irish and other European refugees in the nineteenth, and then again in the early twentieth centuries. Even women who were twenty-one years old in the turn-of-the nineteenth, and early twentieth century's ``middle-class`` strata were required to seek a respectable, well-heeled sponsor, to give consent to a bethrotal if these females ever were to hope to enter what was then regarded as ``respectable`` society``. This all seemed to chagge in America after World War I, as there seemed to have been a definite ``cultural shift``, throwing-off those old traditions of a previous generation and epoch. Edison's age difference is a non-issue. Even in most parts of Asia and Europe today, age in a marriage of an older man to a (well, sometimes much) younger woman is revered. Here, in the States, various wealthly and powerful men, among them old Hollywood and media types flaunt their marriage to virtual child-brides(Woody Allen, Rupert Murdock as obvious examples. Curious-wouldn't you agree-that in both cases cited, these men chose YOUNG, ORIENTAL WOMEN, rather than western ones for their ``sunset years``). In Alva Edison's case, this was sort of a ``wirlwind romance`` manipulated by the girl's uncle, as I cited above, to get at Edison and control of his company. Think Napolean Bonafart's divorce of Josephine to marry a Hapsburgh princess, and the world-shattering events that ensued from such a ``political`` union.

"`NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a ``cunt``. You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to ``cancer``. It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying ``Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do``, as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I ``breed cancer``, that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account ``vanished`` to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a ``cunt`` or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOMG, you are an imbecile.  Seriously.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet's go over this one last time on the remote chance you might finally understand the difference between fact and opinion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI rewrote the contribution using ONLY information that I found on the Internet that supported the contribution.  I did not add anything to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source.  YOU, on the other hand, wrote a contribution that DID add content to the story that could NOT be verified through a reliable source, making it YOUR OPINION.  You said things like  ``... when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of Arvada's police force.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is libelous, because you accuse the Arvada Police Department of ``criminal conduct`` when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law.  Even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found ``not guilty`` by your peers. Because no one is convicted in the link you provide (or ANY link ANYWHERE on the Internet), it is your OPINION.  If you had used the phrase ``ALLEGED criminal conduct`` you would be more on track.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou also wrote: ``Arvada's city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the Arvada police, despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone, during a period of budget crises.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ``close to half a million dollars`` was NOT spent ``defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone.``  The money was spent settling OUT OF COURT so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact.  A ``criminal`` is someone who has been CONVICTED of a crime. So there cannot be ``criminal actions`` unless someone has been convicted of a crime.  There CAN be ``alleged questionable actions,`` which is what you should have written. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion, that opens you up to a LIBEL SUIT.  If you do it in a blog, and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts, you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel.  But when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content, you cannot just post what you THINK.  You must post what can be VERIFIED.   Do you understand this very basic principle?  Please read it again if you don't, because I'm done trying to educate you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDefinition of libel (I encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents):  http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-libel.htmNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLibel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact. In the United States opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech, falling outside the purview of libel. Citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities, including government and officials. Entertainment, parody, editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DefamationNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHow to prove libel:  There are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place. For example, in the United States, the person first must prove that the statement was false. Second, that person must prove that the statement caused harm. And, third, they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. These steps are for an ordinary citizen.

How convenient. And as for Darwinism, which was my other point, you won't find anything on that either. Mussolini never even stated anything about evolution (nor did Hitler, for that matter).

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Unblock ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHello, Mike. After thinking very long and carefully, I have taken the (for me) unusual step of unblocking a user you blocked without consulting you first. You blocked  indefinitely, giving the reason as ``Vandalism-only account``. I have looked at a sample of 20 of the user's 153 edits excluding their user page, and did not find a single one that I could conceive of anyone calling ``vandalism``. Even if there were vandalism edits somewhere among them that I missed, this cannot possibly be described as a ``vandalism-only account``. The user page contained some silly editing, and it might be debatable whether to call it ``use of Wikipedia for inappropriate humour`` or ``vandalism``, but at the most it might have justified a warning. An indefinite block on a user with a significant history of positive contributions because of a silly user page seems dubious, and for such a block to be imposed without any warnings is surely unacceptable. If I have missed something which puts the block in a different light than that in which I have seen it then please let me know.   `",pseudo_civil,0.3,wiki_attacks

To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::  All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Note the distinction. You wrote ``if it can't be verified it gets removed``. But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a ``citation needed`` template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I suppose you could say ``well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source.`` Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term ``solid state disk`` there are no actual ``disks`` inside these devices. In your edit comment you said ``since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]``. Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms ``solid state disk`` or ``electronic disk`` from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what ``good faith`` means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like ``vandalism``.

To begin with, I understand your reasoning for not referring to a deceased person as ``the late so-and-so.`` To begin with, we aren't the World Book Encyclopedia; we are Wikipedia, with a different Manual of Style. I see nothing in there that directs us not to refer to the deceased as I have. The very fact that you have had long arguments about this suggests that it is a matter of contention, and not one that has been resolved with any finality.

If they come back with the determination that ``the late`` is not appropriate, i will remove the reference in the article myself. until then, I am going to reinsert the comment as is. NEWLINE_TOKENAs to the comments that most already know reagan is dead is not an entirely valid argument, aas WP is not a collection of links. We cite our work, yes, but each article should be able to stand on its own, without assuming information.

Editing Wikipedia is a privilege, not a right, like driving a car: you'll keep getting warnings and tickets for bad behavior until your license is lifted.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN# Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at  . Your suggestion that HighKing should ``step back from this type of edit`` is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.NEWLINE_TOKEN# 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!NEWLINE_TOKEN# Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a ``long term campaign of harassment`` without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.NEWLINE_TOKEN# To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an ``inappropriate`` use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",pseudo_civil,0.4,wiki_attacks

Obviously, the authors of this Wiki found a list of Christians who think Jesus is real, and one Atheist (Ehrman). Now it's been compiled into a ridiculous paragraph, as  mentioned, and spread to every Jesus article. Statements from historians like Richard Carrier, or as   your ilk prefer to call him, ``blogger`` are routinely removed from this article as are statements from Ehrman which are critical of historical Jesus claims regarding what is and isn't accepted as historical. So, just because you've compiled a short paragraph,   with a few pastors and priests who think Jesus was real, doesn't mean I have to find a paragraph that states otherwise. The point is, this article is full of that type of BS, and we don't need to disprove your claims any more than we need to disprove claims of a magic spaghetti monster, so quit with your snivelling rhetoric about personal attacks and us finding reliable sources to disprove your positive claims.

"`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::OK, Obi-wan. You're starting to make me suspicious. What do you always ask exactly what I think are the right questions? Own up. Either way, you did not answer my question directly, and I also suspect you know it. ``Does this mean that WPO is not useful to you?`` But you did answer it indirectly. So you get an even more direct question in return: Why make it obvious that you know a lot about Wikipedia, without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? For one, you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. If you don't mind, I'm going to take this straight to the source: WPO peeps, what the dealio? I've asked people on WP to put up or shut up. I've asked the WMF to walk their talk. In fact, I've staked my rep several times now, and I'm not done yet. Now I'm asking you, why don't you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? On-wiki or off-, Obi-wan certainly isn't the first to question your self-righteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than Wikipedia. I, for one, have been wondering for a while now. So, let's see what you can do besides making snarky, personal comments. Here's a pot, and here's a kettle. Need I mention what color they are?NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Onwards with Obi-wan's points. I don't believe in nasty people. Deciding anyone is bad, nasty, etc. has only one purpose; one can feel better about being bad, nasty, etc. to people they've so judged. I don't think this is particularly productive. In fact, IMO it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides- or, more often, others have convinced them- that they themselves are bad people. We could talk about this more in another thread, but we've got to get back on topic here, so. . . You know that the Wikipediocrats are smart. You have spent more time there than you're willing to admit directly. I immediately wonder if it's just in reading or in writing, too. ) They are indeed among the smartest in the WP community reasoning-wise that I've met so far. But emotionally. . . less than average. How do you think many of these smart m'er f'ers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? A lot of them fell from grace, not because they weren't an asset to the community, but because they didn't seem to know when- or they were completely unwilling- to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. That's one part of the answer; many of them are banned or blocked- whether rightly so or not- from editing on Wikipedia. Also, it's normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland, while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. You'll hear the same people spout their disdain for Wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. Frankly, we could speculate about these people's motives and methods til the sun goes down. Let's be more practical about what is best for Wikipedia here. What we, as a Wikipedia community, can't do is ignore them away. And, even if we could, we're doing a piss-poor job of it, because I almost always hear about what's been said on Wikipediocracy from a Wikipedian before I go to the actual site. Ultimately, I go back to my old standard: I don't give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are; all's I know is that they are saying something interesting, and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as I read it.

"`NEWLINE_TOKEN:Binksternet's paranoid and frightening theory propounded about Geraldine Edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.NEWLINE_TOKENOther Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.NEWLINE_TOKENThe San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said ``Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,`` a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.NEWLINE_TOKENAll of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENWhatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase ``Legend in his own mind``. Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject.

Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being ``confrontational`` when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user 's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like ``compliance``, revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are ``being reasonable`` or ``writing nicely``.  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to ``be friends`` with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is ``ganging up`` (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be ``confrontational``?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe headlines are not ``veiled``, they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be ``hidden``.  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a ``personal attack`` because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for ``personal attacks``.  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEdits (in a separate paragraph so that reading it is optional): ``Users working with me should not...revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead`` - Instead of reverting multiple times, attacking, and then harassing, the use",pseudo_civil,0.5,wiki_attacks

"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== This may seem a little out of the blue and all... ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHello, Max, this is indef-blocked User:Doughnuthead speaking. I firmly believe I can finally be of positive use to Wikipedia, and I no longer feel the need to gain attention through malicious editing. I'd actually all but forgotten about all the nonsense i had caused in the previous years until i saw a funny picture online of a guy with a swollen head, which reminded me of my username. But more to the point, i realised that my ability to edit the talk page was barred. After taking a look at previous edits, i realised i was being a bit of a tube. You were right to take that ability away. So just a heads up that i can only edit on anon as this account is obviously still suspended. In terms of getting unblocked, i haven't made a single edit to Wikipedia in almost 3 years, and during this time i have matured enough to the point that i look back at what i was getting up to and think 'Oh god! Who was i even trying to impress?!' In terms of where i aim to get involved in on the website, I still hold a strong interest in football (soccer) related articles, along with hip-hop and old school rock related articles- hence my music taste. As it has been so long since I bothered to use the editing facility, I'll need re-shown how to work various parts of the site or whatever it's called. I only remembered how to request unblock by clicking on the 'edit' tab and noticing one of my old templates! Furthermore, I don't intend to be an overly active user on the site, as I begin my university course in September much of my time will be dedicated towards my studies, and so I intend to see Wikipedia as a hobby to input my thoughts and research every now and then. Finally, thank you very much for reading my request - I appreciate the time taken to do so and I apologise for my past behaviour. I was just a stupid kid (it lasted from age 12-15 if I recall!) and I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the ``first do no harm`` idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day.

The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise. MEDRS is no catch all, but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. I would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically, for example by having FDA warnings automatically added.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I understand it may feel as if you're being reverted by a faceless mass, but I assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive.

Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called ``Coal Wars``. I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal.

She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her ``Happiness`` article under the section ``Philsoophy of Happiness.`` Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: ``Unsourced`` as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me ``ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR.`` I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me ``your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them.`` Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.

It wrote under the NAME section on Afghanistan's article that Afghanistan's first constitution was in 1964 and wants the world to believe this lie. Here is 1923 constitution of Afghanistan >link You know what?...since now I am convinced Wikipedia is all false information written by people who enjoys spreading false information to the world....I give up on editing Afghanistan's article. Afghanistan is ruled by the majority Pashtuns and the whole world is fully aware of this...so it doesn't matter what you write in the Wikipedia on Afghanistan. Wikipedia has nothing but low life losers who don't have nothing else in life but write false information...hahahahahahahaha. Shame on you all for writing false information.  lies like an old Persian rug...nobody even bothers looking at it.  is a racist Shia...I can easily tell by his actions...and so can everyone else. It refuses to acknowledge that Sunni population is about 90% while Shia is less than 10%. I came to make the article more proffesional and more easy to understand for people with reliable sources....but I am being prevented...so I just give up...it's not even worth doing it. I am now beginning to feel really ashamed of being someone from Afghanistan...because of people like User:Tajik. So go ahead write all the BULL you can write about Afghanistan...I give up on it...besides...not many people take Wikipedia serious and there is nothing interesting to write about Afghanistan. The fact remains that we Pashtuns rule the country with the help of Pakistan, which is equipped with 100s of nuclear bombs and very supportive of Pashtuns...hahahahahahaha  09:32, 31 October 2006",uncivil,0.7,wiki_attacks

I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCamille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of ``traditional`` values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a ``respectable`` face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.`",uncivil,0.7,wiki_attacks

"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Amandajm: Ignorant Muslim & Disgusting Anti-white Racist==NEWLINE_TOKENReading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are.

Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure. NEWLINE_TOKEN",uncivil,0.8,wiki_attacks

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Reply from ColonelHenry===NEWLINE_TOKENI have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?NEWLINE_TOKEN* First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical ``rule nazi`` editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly ``this user is an asshole`` and explain why and state ``this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia`` I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say ``asshole`` once, I get blocked.  She calls me a ``dick`` over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.NEWLINE_TOKEN* In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to ``wait until after TFA`` and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize ``hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.``  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.NEWLINE_TOKEN* And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's ``Will to Power`` or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for why, I like ``nineteenth`` as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for ``brevity's sake`` on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to ``kick rocks.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs far as I'm concerned, this is over.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a ``transitional`` state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa. So I honestly believe that you're about 180 degrees on this one - your statement, while eloquent, was somewhat meaningless, whereas History makes some valid points (the most valid of which is that if you (speaking in the generic, non-threatening second person) call me a ``southerner``, I will tie you to the back of a pickup truck and drag you to your death while throwing beer cans out the window to hit you in your skull.  `",uncivil,0.7,wiki_attacks

I've said it three times, repeated it in the post you are refering to, and still you went on to make accusations about ``  a desire to focus on his point of view and not the consensus``, when I have jsut said, I reverted you VANDALISM becuase you vandalised the defintion and not because of the reference to affirmative action. If you continue to lie about me I will stop acting friendly towards your edits, you irrational individual who I am struggling not to label negatively. There is no point about the affirmative action reference, as I said in the previous post. The fact I would contradict your lies (that affirmative action isn't always discrimination, when it is) is unrelated to that statement and your vandalism. If you feel a bit concerned about imaginary things, perhaps you should see a fucking psychiatrist, because feeling concerned about things that don't exist is extreme paranoia. Accuse me of bad faith again without a shred of evidence and i will strive to irritate you for every second until they block me. I cannot stand lieing and complete apathy towards actual responding to what I write as opposed to what you imagine I write. I advice you do not respond to this with anything but an apology, I can't see it being pretty. And now some quotes from the post you responded to, so that those smarter than you can laugh at your irrational response, ``I have no interest in your line on Affirmative action``, ``the arrogance which drives you to completely brush off the rest of the edit and come here and accuse me of POV, when I was reverting to a consesnsus over an unsourced redefinition``, ``I don't give a toss about the link between affirmatvie action and disscrimination`` and ``stop accusing me of things that pop into your head``.

Having contributed nothing to music himself, it is outrageous that he would have the nerve to attack what is arguably the greatest Queen album. Nonetheless, we need criticism as well in order to better balance the article out. I have also added many wonderful things lately, such as Freddie's top listings in international polls, so don't worry too much.

Oh right, my pen-name is The Persian Cataphract, so let me try to decipher your next tactical move. The race card? Oh right, your name's not Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson. Let me guess the next one. Nationalist. That's right, you'll throw each and every syllable of content present in my message, in favour of this preconceived straw-man, fallacy and red herring. You'll probably even point to my liberal use of profanity. I just must be nothing else than this lion-and-sun foam-at-mouth Persian nationalist with an inferiority complex spiced with a pinch of victim mentality. And certainly I must be dumb, as you so eloquently have arbitrated above.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou said it yourself, right here:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN...I am used to being attacked by editors whose very account names show they are here for single-topic pov-pushing. Who do you expect to be neutral on topics of Iranian nationalism? A user called ``IranianGuy``, or a Swiss editor contributing under his real name and no stakes in the matter? Who, for that matter, do you expect to be neutral on topics of Armenian nationalism, an editor called ``AraratArev`` (vel sim.)...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs that how you assess content? By making a shallow assumption on pen-names? Expectations? The God-given right to anonymity on the Internet? How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator? What next, are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iran-related articles? Indeed not just a laughable policy, but indeed a dangerous one as well. Most of the world-class authorities are Iranians. With your fucked up logic, we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content, you'll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection. Oh right, you're Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization, you're obviously this stereotypical neutralist... Good lord, listen to yourself. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLuckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content. That's NPOV. A sober, neutral, objective approach, just bare-bones, bare-knuckles source critique. Source. Critique. Make an assessment on the content, not the person(s). You marginalized IranianGuy. Period. And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his pen-name, you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach.

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Worst Season ever ==NEWLINE_TOKENAnyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what ``good quality`` is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, ``For Here or To Go``? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in ``Gary Takes a Bath``, but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.

Specifically, I take issue with the entire ``Differences between the 800 and 850 series`` section, because I contend that there is no such thing as a ``T-850``.  Stan Winston Studios, which designed the terminators for the films, confirmed this to me via e-mail when I wrote to them asking their opinion.  Their response (direct quote): ``I'm not sure where the T-850 came from.  As far as I know, Arnold's Terminator has and always will be the T-800, model 101.  Now, the robot Terminators in T3 are T1's and Kristana Loken is the TX.  I hope that clears it up...``  While the term ``T-850`` is somewhat widespread on the internet, even extending to T3-related merchandise such as action figures, its origin is, to my mind, something of a mystery.

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! NEWLINE_TOKENHow long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?NEWLINE_TOKENWith a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. NEWLINE_TOKENI have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. NEWLINE_TOKENI have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter.

First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!NEWLINE_TOKENAnd that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see...

"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Unblock Request: Fuck you, unblock me! ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",uncivil,0.8,wiki_attacks

Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking ``research`` from questionable sources and only ever ``research`` or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have ``won`` the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5.

And that doesnt even count the numerous 'revolutionaries' who fought for their own country while killing it off. Dont push this social policy bullshit cause in reality it has no base.
