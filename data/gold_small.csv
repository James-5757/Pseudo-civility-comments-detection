What is more, I notice that none, repeat NONE, has been able to stop his adventures. He is freely doing what he wants to and none of you has been able to stop him from his anarchy. Else, show me one example where any of you has stopped him in his tracks. Why is it that he has always got to be right??? His POVs are NPOVs while researched stuff by us is POV or simply garbage because there is no arbitrator between him and me. Just show me one example of arbitration in my case. I also notice that others who contributed to this article on Johnson C. Philip are not raising their voice. I know one of them (my junior who also did research on Philip). He told me he would never come back to Wiki, so disappointed was he also to see Arbustoo having his way and none of you coming to arbitration.

Please do read that note.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut he removed my first warning and also reverted back the pathetic PA comment on roy's user page ALONG WITH pathetic PA's AGAIN, in both edit summaries.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI gave him a final warning as he repeatedly violated NPA and would not cease and desist.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYet he continued with his same unacceptable behaviour.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe edit histories of the talk pages of  and  will make this very clear. He keeps deleting and reverting along with PA's in the edit summary inspite of being EXPLICITLY warned.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is totally unacceptable. Please do take immediate action.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou know me, atleast a little. There is no way anyone can get away with calling me a vandal. You know I am not here to vandalize, but I have contributed meaningfully to a few articles whatever little time I have been on here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOf course, there were a few misinformed civil issues along the way (which served to inform me about the policy on civility, NPA etc.), but after the block and blowing off a little steam, my behaviour has been perfectly good as can be expected of any genuine user.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENeven Vesther for that matter with whom I had a little argument would not call me a vandal.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso there is another admin Nearly Headless Nick who has appreciated my edits to a certain page. NEWLINE_TOKENAlso have made a few edits to other articles the few times i was on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut surely just because anyone is a very occasional user, that CANNOT be used as an excuse for letting anyone get away with PAs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, NPA specifically states that earlier misinformed mistakes and behaviour CANNOT be used as an EXCUSE for a PA. NEWLINE_TOKENIf people kept harping on about old issues, it would become acceptable to attack anyone as everyone makes mistakes in the past.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCrossmr  just CANNOT be allowed to get away with his unacceptable MALICIOUS behaviour.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease BLOCK him symbolically for whatever time you feel is right, to mainly PREVENT him and later forbid him from:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1. Reverting the pathetic PA on Roy's page along with the pathetic PA edit summaries.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. Removing my very first warning message with a very civil note. I dont care about the second warning, but the first warning serves as a placeholder for record's sake.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEven after EXPLICIT and SPECIFIC warnings not to continue, he continued with his unacceptable behaviour and BLATANTLY violated NPA that too in edit summaries.NEWLINE_TOKENEven after being explicitly advised to assume good faith (AGF), he has failed to do so.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCmon, for whatever you think of me (ur earlier silence), you KNOW I am not a vandal.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease take appropriate steps as a fair and upright ADMIN.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am logging off now, other stuff to do.

It was put up 22 November 2006, reverted 28 November 2006, and has been there until now. Look for this abuse to return soon.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN Facts are stubborn.  NEWLINE_TOKEN: The US Federal government's definition of sexual assault includes ``inappropriate touching`` (see ) Ellison's sexual assault on Willis at the Hugo Awards is thoroughly documented to an unusual extent for any encyclopedia: to use correct terminology for an event that is completely verifiable is certainly not actionable.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::The first of the 'Three Most Important Things' anecdote was retitled by an anon editor who objected to having Ellison's self-described behavior referred to as 'sexual assault'. I put it back in because it is sourced as well as any of the other controversies and is certainly notable: Ellison not only published the anecdote he told, but is reported to have recounted it several times at conventions.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Provided it is from a reliable sourced (it is) and we make it clear it's veracity is uncertain (we do) there are only two other issues. Is it sufficiently noteable (appears to be but can't say for sure) and is it documented as controversial (no clear info on this)? The fact that you and I may think it is controversial is irrelevant if it isn't documented as controversial. Given it's noteability, there might be merit to include it somewhere else if it isn't documented as controversial but not in the controversies section  NEWLINE_TOKEN::: Will try to find documentation of controversy: what controversy I'm aware of occurred exclusively in fandom, which tends not to be documented up to Wikipedia standards.

It has been removed again. Please do not turn this into an edit war, but consider why you feel the need to hate Mr. Ellison and to continual find ways to attack him in an encyclopedia. Facts are stubborn.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::: Please remember: assume good faith. Accusations that wiki editors include information in biographies based on personal animosity towards the subject, is hardly an assumption of good faith. This anecdote is directly sourced to Ellison: it may or may not to be true, but not only did he repeat it at several conventions, he also published it under his own name as something he had done. It is therefore quite literally a self-incriminating account of a sexual assault Ellison carried out, or said he did, in 1962. The argument has been made that this is ``not controversial``, and therefore ought to be under a different section: I cannot, however, see any good reason to remove it altogether: though as you will see other anecdotes that are not sourced have been removed.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::I can still see no reason that this incident should even be in an ``encyclopedia``, even a self-labeled one. Use of the inflammatory label ``sexual assault`` appears to meet standard of personal attack, and if it cannot be supported in its legal meaning, it is actionable.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::I also do not see why that particular terminology is so important when there are other terms that would not look like personal attack could easily be substituted.

", 18 January 2007 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.NEWLINE_TOKENJerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)NEWLINE_TOKENAnd about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name. Again, dont go off the topic, this was about hte inquisition.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd yes, I bloomin love life under Islam, as a woman I feel liberated and free, and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported, and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth (there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans!!!!) If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us.

"`:::::: Dear Chris, It took me a while to uderstand what happened. Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your ``seen in the above insulting comments`` which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say ``where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools``. Why do you think that ``Einstein, Landau and Feynman`` are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned ``world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools``. So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one. Advice to BB folks: state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you won't need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you. Otherwise you'll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein, Landau and Feynman since they don't understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have.

At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was ``willing to discuss`` various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to ``edit warring`` consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp.

"`I still cannot believe that there can be a controversy over our national anthem! This is absurd! What the hell happened? Freedom of speech, I am all for it. But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting ``immigrants``. They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of ``God`` and ``son`` means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be ``friends``??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like ``The Beatles``! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: ``You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you.`` This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to ``area of rest``- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner.

Believe me, I can get so many unique IP address' that banning me is a waste of time (since you see I am already on my 4th user account [and I couldnt care less for your policy on that]). Showing off my number of banned accounts to all my friends is fun, so if you wanna play it that way, remember that you have an audience rooting for youNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd another thing. You wiki admins are all Caption retards. In the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Mattkachu , you claim that Mattkachu==Steven1350.

"`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::There, that's what I am trying to say.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*Hindu nationalism has an already an article. I don't see the point of reiterating it here again.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*The article was NOT created as an extension of Hindi-Muslim conflict. That part is already mentioned here: Islam_in_India#Hindu-Muslim_conflict. If you think that is what needs to be done, please move it to Hindu-Muslim_conflict.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Anti-Buddhist can be removed, specially since his son himself corrected the mistakes. But on the otherhand, anti-christian, muslim, sikhism, hindu - they are fought over petty local policies and given the color of religion by recalling ancient atrocities. It would be akin to Spanish acquisition causing anti-Spanish violence now.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::While you and me know what 'Religious Violence in India' typically refers to, a year from now it will refer to what the article's name suggest, with a new batch of trolls and POV pushers revert warring every edit. The article was created to quench the India-bashing thirst. At least I fail to see any other reason for its existence, because otherwise we wouldn't be discussing what the article really refers to etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Also, don't forget then the anti-Hindu violence, specially in southern India and eastern India - places where Hindus are in minority. And don't forget that the riots are never one sided. Right now the article looks like a list of religious atrocities committed in India, which is a ridiculous topic, but I believe it can be turned into a comprehensible and well cited article. That's why I think going according to ``time`` will help.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::The problem with going X vs Y vs Z position is that it will never be NPOV, it will never be factual, and it will never be comprehensible. `",0.3,wiki_attacks,TRUE,pseudo_civil,FALSE,TRUE,civil
